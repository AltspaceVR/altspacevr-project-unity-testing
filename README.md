# AltspaceVR Engineering Project - Unity Testing

## Overview

This project involves adding a few different integration tests to a simple Unity game, and writing up a hypothetical testing strategy for the game going forward.

To work on the project:
- Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.3.4p1)
- Fork and clone the repo

## Goals



# Part 1 - Integration Tests

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/46209

Please build tests that verify the following aspect of the game

- A tank receives damage when hit by a shell
- The frame-rate of the game does not drop below 60 for more than 300 milliseconds
- Both tanks are constantly visible during 10 seconds of random movement

# Part 2 - Testing Strategy

Consider that this tank game is going to be built out into a competitive online PC video game. There will be a large number of different tank and weapon types, and the game will recieve continuous updates to improve balance and add new features. The team will have 20 people on the project in various roles. 

Please write up a one page overview of what a cohesive testing strategy would look like that would allow for continuous depolyment while minimizing downtime and bugs that negatively impacted the experience for players.  

## Deliverable

In your repo, you should clobber this README file with your testing strategy. Any instructions or known issues should be documented in the README as well.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to `projects@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
